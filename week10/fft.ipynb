    "This session introduces the fast fourier transform (FFT) which is one of the most widely used numerical algorithms in the world. It exploits some features of the symmetry of the computation of the DFT to reduce the complexity to something that takes order $N^2$ ($O(N^2)$) complex operations to something that takes order $N log N$ ($O(N \\log N)$) operations.

    "<sup>1</sup>*Note*: addition of two complex numbers $(a + jb) + (c + jd) = (a+b) + j(b + d)$ so requires 2 floating-point additions; multiplication $(a + jb)(c + jd) = (ac - bd)+j(ad + bc)$ requires four floating-point multiplications and two additions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In MATLAB, complex numbers are represented internally as two 64 bit floating point operations so each complex operation is expensive both in terms of computing time and working memory space. And the result of an N-point DFT will require twice the memory of the original sequence, assuming that it is stored as floating point real numbers, considerably 16 times the storage is needed if the original sequence is the result of sampling by, say, an 8 bit ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, modern 64 bit mirocprocessers have hardware support for floating point operations and so these operations take a minumum number of machine cycles. Digital Signal Processors and Graphic Processing Units, probably have hardware support for complex arithmetic too. Nonethess, complex arithmetic is an expensive operation, so any simplifications we can make will be valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>2</sup>Even if we do not have a real sequence, we only need to compute the first $N/2$ values of the spectrum because the sequence for $X[k]$ from $N/2 + 1 < k <= N-1$ are complex conjugates, in the reverse order, of the sequence of $X[k]$ for $0 <= k < N/2$. This is easy to prove by looking at the geometry of the unit circle in the z-plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>3</sup>If $N=1024$, $N\\log_2 N = 1024*10 = 10,240$ complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>4</sup>The Inverse FFT (IFFT) follows by noting that the rotation vector used in its computation is the complex conjugate\n",
    "$$W_N^{-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>5</sup> Karris goes further in showing how the decomposition used to implement the FFT can be further be understood by considering even and odd decompositions. We do not have time to cover this in this module, but you are invited to read further if you are interested. You'll also find that most text books on Digital Signal Processing will cover the FFT and give more or less understandable presentations of the way the algorithm works."
