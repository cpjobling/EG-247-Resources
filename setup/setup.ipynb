    "However, to fully access all the examples that have been provided as Jupyter notebooks for EG-247 you will need to install both MATLAB (I used MATLAB 2017B) and Python 3 (I used Anaconda 3) and this is something of a technical challenge.\n",

Other teachers have also advocated the use of Live Script in teaching, e.g. [Teaching with Matlab Live Scripts](http://bastibe.de/2016-06-15-matlab-live-scripts.html).
