    "This session is an introduction to sampling theory. It reviews the important ideas that pertain to sampling but leaves the detailed mathematics for your further study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material in this presentation and notes is based on Chapter 15 of [Benoit Boulet, Fundamentals of Signals and Systems](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10228195) from the **Recommended Reading List** and you'll find the mathematical treatments there. There is much more detail in Chapter 9 of [Steven T. Karris, Signals and Systems: with Matlab Computation and Simulink Modelling, 5th Edition](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416) from the **Required Reading List**."

    "The concepts presented in this session provide a model that allows us to cross the bridge between the theoretical concept of impulse chain sampling through to a representation of a signal as discrete sequence $x[n]$ (to be introduced next lecture) and back to a continuous-time signal via reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics predicts the nature of the signals that are processed in the ideal case, but we will leave it with you to study these for yourself. (See Boulet pp 552&mdash;557).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, modern digital processing relies on the use of an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) (which also introduces amplitude quantization), finite-length arithmetic inside the discrete-time system (usually a microprocessor, microcontroller or digital signal processor), followed by conversion back to a step-wise continuous signal via a digital to analogue converter (DAC) that operates like a zero-order-hold.\n",

    "* In modern signal processing and digital communications many of the operations that were once done in continuous time are now done entirely in discrete time.\n",

    "* For example, we can implement sampling and modulation in discrete time.\n",
